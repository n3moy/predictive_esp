Predictive ESP
==============================

Predictive maintenance of esp operation failures

This project was made as my qualification work at university. 
After graduation I took part in MLOps course from Open Data Science community (https://ods.ai/tracks/ml-in-production-spring-22)
and completed whole project with production functionality.

I Used:
- Airflow
- MLFlow 
- S3 storage Minio for artifacts storage
- Postgres DB for Airflow and MLFlow data authorization, experiments, paths, dag runs, users etc.

Airflow DAGs dependencies:
